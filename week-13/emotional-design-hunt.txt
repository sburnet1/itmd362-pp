# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:

The shape and overall style of this pencil makes it worthy enough to buy because it looks like any other mechanical pencil out there that we have all bought.  

* Behavioral:

The overall simplicity of this pencil makes it nice.  Reloading the led is just pushing the end, the grip makes it a nice hold rather than straight on the plastic. 

* Reflective:

With pencils not really changing designs too often, a lot of people can look at their pencils and reminisce about the good ole days when they were kids, first using mechanical pencils.  The standard design really allows users to keep history with them. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1.The simplicity of the design
2.The recognition of the design
3.The intention of being standard.
